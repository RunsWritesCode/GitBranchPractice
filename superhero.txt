Once upon a time a normal human slept in.
She was tired of fixing the mess that the superheroes beings kept making.

Her motivation was at an all time high.
Eventually she managed to drag herself out of bed.
But instead of saving the world she watched Stranger Things on Netflix and ate ice-cream.
The end.
